# FuseERP Assessment - Getting Started Guide with React, Vite, Yarn, and Tailwind CSS

Welcome to the **FuseERP Assessment** repository! This guide will help you get the project up and running on your local machine using React, Vite, Yarn, and Tailwind CSS. Please follow the instructions below to set up the environment, install dependencies, and start the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Yarn Package Manager**: We'll be using Yarn to manage dependencies. If you don't have Yarn installed, you can get it from [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Olalekan-Adeyeye/fu-assesment.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project's root directory:
   ```
   cd fu-assesment
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use Yarn to install the project dependencies, including Tailwind CSS:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

## Configuration

Before you can start the project, you might need to configure some settings. Typically, these can be found in files like `.env` or configuration files.

## Adding Tailwind CSS

We've already included Tailwind CSS in the project, but you might need to customize its styles. You can find the Tailwind configuration in the `tailwind.config.js` file. Edit this file to adjust colors, fonts, spacing, and more.

## Starting the Project with Vite

Once you have the dependencies installed and any necessary configurations set up, you can start the project:

1. **Start Development Server**: Run the following command to start the development server using Vite:
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running. Vite's development server is fast and efficient, providing instant updates.

## Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy the project, you'll need to create a production build. Run the following command to generate optimized, minified, and production-ready assets:

```
yarn build
```

The build output will be located in the `dist` directory.

## Additional Information

If you encounter any issues, consult the project documentation or seek help from the community. You can also check for specific instructions or troubleshooting guides in the project's repository or related resources.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up and started the **FuseERP Assessment** project using React, Vite, Yarn, and Tailwind CSS. Feel free to explore the project's features, make changes, and contribute to its development. Happy coding!
